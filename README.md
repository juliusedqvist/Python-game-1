# Python-game-1
Just your regular python text based detective game


To run the program just copy all the files into something that runs python. all the files need to be in the same directory.
run the program from main.py



The main idea behind the game:

"You're a detective that has been hired to solve a murder. You'll make a thesis by asking the suspects questions about 
the different the other suspects (You can also ask them about themselves) and then test the thesis via the accuse function.

The riddle takes some time to complete and i encourage you to not give up. On the other hand if you find it to easy please give
me feedback and I'll look into it.


How to play:

First choose difficulty by typing easy. There aren't any other difficultys but I think it adds to the experience.
Then type no to not skip the story (you can type yes to skip it if your unpatient but again everything else will just play it.)

Start by inputing the name of the suspect you want to question first. For an example: queen. Then you'll se some text appear, 
note that this is information that can help you, continue by typing the suspect you want the queen to tell you about.

if you want to ask that suspect about someone else just type their name (note that you can ask them about themselfes. Some will
give you very useful information, others will not. It is also possible to ask about the king. Otherwise type thanks and then talk
to choose another suspect to question.

When you have gathered all the information you need and have a thesis about the murder type thanks and then instead of talk type
accuse. You then have to enter the one you think is guilty and their reason for murder.

Known bugs:

not completly following the instructions during the accuse function will cause the program to crash. example just entering
blacksmith will cause a crash.

entering nothing at all will also cause a crash.
